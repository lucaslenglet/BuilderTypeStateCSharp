# BuilderTypeStateCSharp
Builder pattern with TypeState constraints in CSharp (inspired from Rust pattern of the same name).

Learned from the video ["Rust Programming: TypeState Builder Pattern Explained"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwmIQzLuYl0) by [Jeremy Chone](https://www.youtube.com/@JeremyChone) on YouTube.
